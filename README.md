# Hi there, I'm Prateek Sharma 👋

## About Me
I’m a software developer with 7 years of experience across backend systems, full-stack web apps, and data-centric products. I recently completed my coursework for a Master’s in Computer Science at Rochester Institute of Technology (GPA: 3.9) and am currently working on my capstone project this Fall. I am **actively seeking full-time roles** in **Software Development**, and I am available to start immediately—even during my capstone.

🚀 I recently interned at **Tilaverse Inc.**, where I led a small dev team to build a full-stack AI-powered learning platform using React, Django, and Docker.

💡 I'm passionate about building scalable systems, solving real-world problems with clean code, and applying AI/Data Science in meaningful ways.
